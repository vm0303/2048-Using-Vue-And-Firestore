# 2048 Game In Vue CLI and Google Firestore
This is a version of the popular game 2048 written in Vue CLI and Google Firestore. It took me about 2 months to fully
complete this project and I can honestly say that I'm so proud of what I accomplished here. 

Shout out to [PiggyDiggy](https://github.com/PiggyDiggy) for helping me on a crucial compenent when a user swipes the board on a mobile device.
