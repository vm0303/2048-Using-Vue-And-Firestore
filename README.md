# 2048 Game In Vue CLI and Google Firestore
This is a version of the popular game 2048 written in Vue CLI and Google Firestore. It took me about 2 months to 
complete this project and I can honestly say that I'm so proud of what I accomplished here. Link will come soon. 
There seems to be an issue with the scrolling on mobile devices.
